  Load Balanced Linux servers running [Django](http://djangoproject.com) with
  [Django-CMS](http://django-cms.org) installed into a
  [Python](http://python.org) [Virtual Environment](http://virutalenv.org)
  running behind [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) with
  [mod_wsgi](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/). The backend is a Cloud
  Database running [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/).
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  As soon as the deployment finishes building, you can access your site by
  hitting the Django CMS URL in the outputs section. From the Django CMS
  default home page there will be a link to go into edit mode which will pop up
  a login prompt at the top of your browser. Use the Django Admin User and
  Password provided in the outputs to login to begin managing your site.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  A system user of 'pydev' has been created. This user has owns the [Virtual
  Environment](http://virutalenv.org) setup in '/srv/workspace'. If you need to
  install additional packages with pip, run 'source
  /srv/workspace/bin/activate' as the 'pydev' user prior to running 'pip
  install'.

  The Django CMS can be found in '/srv/workspace/mysite'. All installed
  applications and settings can be found in 'mysite/settings.py'.

  The CMS is served by [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) leveraging
  [mod_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/). The mod_wsgi configuration can be found
  in '/etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi.conf', and the Apache site configuration
  can  be found within '/etc/apache2/sites-available/mysite.conf'. Any changes
  to configuration files will require Apache to be restarted or reloaded.

  #### Logging In via SSH
  The Linux user provided with this deployment will provide you SSH access to
  your servers. This user will have sudo access to gain root access.
  Alternatively, the private key provided in the passwords section can be used
  to login as root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with
  [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
